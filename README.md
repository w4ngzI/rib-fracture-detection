Even though we have uploaded the predict results on validation and test dataset, there is no need for TA to download and evaluate the validation results. The ONLY thing TA need to do is check the performance on test dataset since we have done the evaluation process LOCALLY on the validation dataset.

We have achieved <font color="red">57.45</font> average recall(froc) in the validation dataset finally. Unfortunately, we have no time to upload the predicted test dataset to the Ribfrac Challenge Website. Thus, we upload the predicted results on test dataset in this repo.
